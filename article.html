            The answer depends on the kind of run you have planned, according to Kacie Vavrek, RD, a board-certified
specialist in sports dietetics and an outpatient dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center
in Columbus. If you're planning on a run that lasts for an hour or longer, it's helpful to have a pre-workout
snack that you tolerate well. That choice is highly individual, she adds, and it takes some experimentation to
figure out what works for you. <br>

In general, a snack that has a blend of lean protein and carbohydrates tends to be best, adds Hopkinsville,
Kentucky-based dietitian Elizabeth Ray, RDN. For example, a small amount of skinless grilled chicken paired
with a serving of sweet potatoes. Other options include: <br>

1. Banana or apple with nut butter <br>

2. Toast with half an avocado and a tablespoon of honey <br>

3. Small bowl of oatmeal and berries <br>

4. Bagel with nut butter <br>

Too much protein, like a whole chicken breast or more, usually isn't advisable since it requires longer to
digest when combined with carbs, per research. This means energy isn't as readily available to your body as
the energy you get from quick-digesting carbs. <br>

Generally, says Vavrek, a snack with quick-digesting carbs like a banana or a bagel works well, provided you
had a regular meal about four hours beforehand. If you're running first thing in the morning, just the snack is
probably enough. <br>

“It really is variable, because some people can eat a huge meal right before a run and they're fine, while
others definitely can't do that,” she adds. “Keeping a log of what you eat and how you felt on your run is the
best way to figure it out for yourself.”

        <h2>IS CARB LOADING A THING?</h2>

        <p>The theory behind loading up on carbs is that they fill the body with energy so you
            can maximize your performance, usually about 12 hours before a big run. For
            example, some runners swear by eating pasta the night before a race and may eat
            more white bread, rice, and starchy foods the week leading up to the race, says
            Ray.</p>
